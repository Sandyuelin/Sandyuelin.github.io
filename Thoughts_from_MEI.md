### [Alex Wang: Why Data Not Compute is the Bottleneck to Foundation Model Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNbEr9F0wiE&t=34s)
- three pillars for ML/AI: algorithm, compute, and data
- data empower reasoning
    - cause of lack of reasoning in machine 
         - learn the data from the internet which w/o the complex logic chain
    - solution
        - process-and-logic-included data mining 
        - advanced knowledge in fundamental science(eg: Bio, Physics)
- ai customization
    - enterprises need more **customization**(process of altering a product or services to satisfy specific desire), **personalization and purpose-built for their business**
    - future software engineers need to translate the real-world problems into egineering problems to be solved by ai agents/tools 
- C vs A
   - CCP system of approach towards industry is not the most innovative, but most centralized(which enables it catch up with the pioneers)
